    I hope you are doing well.
    Are you excited about the summer break?
    I am looking forward to the summer vacation. I am really excited about my summer plans.
    I am watching the Champions League final in Istanbul. The match is on 10th June in Olympic Stadium. I am flying on 9th June. I am staying in the Intercontinental Istanbul hotel. I am going to visit Bosphorus strait which connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. I am also going to go sightseeing, Taksim Square, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Grand Bazaar. On the 10th night, I am going to the stadium to watch the final match of the season at 9 o'clock. The weather is going to be nice and it is going to be a perfect match. Lastly, I am leaving on the 11th.

    I can't wait for the trip. What are you planning to do?
    Have a nice summer vacation.

    Best regards,

        Dear Mr. Greg,

        Thank you for your email.

        I'm writing to inform you that I can attend the induction day on Friday.
        I'm not free Thursday because I'm going to attend a conference all day. I can join on Friday. However, I have a dentist appointment at 8.30 that day. So, I may be late and I could be at the factory at 10 am.
        
        I apologize for the inconvenient. I look forward to hearing from you.

        Best regards,
        Hung
